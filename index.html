        <h1>Colin</h1>
        <p>Colin is growing at a rapid pace, crawling around the house at lightning speed. He takes five steps at this time, but is smart enough to know that he can get there faster by crawling. He has been off bottles for awhile now and only uses his sippy cups! He loves playing with his toys, as well as the dogs. He enjoys long walks, given that snacks are provided immediately upon departure. His current interests include pushing every button in sight, poking everyone’s eyes to show you that he recognizes the word, clapping, asking for “more” of everything, throwing bath toys over the edge of the tub and then wanting them back, and asking to read the same books up to six times in a row. We are still holding out hope that someday he will enjoy the car, and we can travel somewhere outside of Berwyn, PA.

        <h1>Hayley</h1>
        <p>Hayley’s final year of elementary school is well underway. She joined the cheer team this year after participating in the camp team two summers in a row, and she has enjoyed it tremendously. Her team won first place at their first regional competition and advanced to NY, but they unfortunately couldn’t compete due to several unforeseen illnesses. Hayley is also loving gymnastics and has gone from a decent cartwheel to an aerial (no handed cartwheel!) in less than a year, just by practicing in the basement. We finally got the hint and signed her up for tumbling classes, which she started this month. She’s also involved in Girl Scouts and Dance, and her social calendar is longer and everyone else’s in the family combined.</p>

        <h1>Kyle and Jess</h1>
        <p>Kyle and Jessica are in survival mode; busy, but happy. They enjoy their city commutes, as long as no trains get stranded during power outages. Kyle is busy with the Philly Thoughtbot office, continuing to network, gain new clients, and run meet-ups. Jessica started her new job as an OB Nurse this past September, and she loves it. She is also an alumni interviewer for Penn and enjoys helping decide the fate of innocent, hardworking high school seniors. Their weekends are spent keeping up with Hayley’s social calendar and helping Colin avoid electric shock and the ingestion of dangerous substances. Sometimes there’s even time for laundry.</p>
